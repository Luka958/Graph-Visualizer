# Graph Visualizer

## Deployment
[Render](https://graph-visualizer-iu9l.onrender.com/)

## Environment
```NODE_VERSION=20.11.1``` 

## Setup
Run the following commands:
1. install dependencies ```npm install```
2. seed the database ```npm run seed```
3. start the project ```npm run start```

## Note
The following changes were applied to achieve easier setup:
- The Facebook integration was removed because the application is not hosted
- C++ addons were removed
- PostgreSQL was replaced with the SQLite

## Usage
Going through a registration process is boring if you want to test the application quickly. Therefore, you can use the default, i.e., the admin user with the following credentials:
- username: `admin`
- password: `admim`
