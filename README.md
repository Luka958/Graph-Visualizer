# Graph Visualizer

## Setup for non-technical Windows users
Navigate to the `windows` directory, right-click on each `.bat` file, and select `Send to` > `Desktop` to create shortcuts on the desktop.

## Setup
Run the following commands:
1. install dependencies ```npm install```
2. seed the database ```npm run seed```
3. start the project ```npm run start```

## Note
The following changes were applied to achieve easier setup:
- The Facebook integration was removed because the application is not hosted
- C++ addons were removed
- PostgreSQL was replaced with the SQLite

## Usage
Going through a registration process is boring if you want to test the application quickly. Therefore, you can use the default, i.e., the admin user with the following credentials:
- username: `admin`
- password: `admim`
